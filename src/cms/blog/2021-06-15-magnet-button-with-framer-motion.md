## Are you sure that your website can cope with it? 

You can find out what your website is able to cope with only with testing. The testing is required to know how properly the product is working and whether it is easy-to-understand for users. QA engineers are responsible for development of test scenarios and preparation and evaluation of test results, but they’re not the only people who perform this. 

### Design testing

Design testing is a check of layout for design compliance. A product designer is responsible for this.  After a developer has finished their work, a designer shall check if everything has proper appearance and shows appropriate behavior. If there are any questions, a designer shall report a bug or decide with a developer on the need to redo something. 

**Typical problems that could be found during the design testing:**

* incorrect spacings; 
* missed states on interactive elements;
* bad animation timing or easing.

### Functional testing

This is to confirm that the software product being developed has the entire range of the customer’s functionality which is proved to meet all expectations. The key idea here is to make sure that the website itself works properly.

**Examples of what may go wrong:**

* a login form doesn’t allow the user to login with proper email;
* it is not possible to open a checkout page even though the products were added to the cart;
* literally any other functional or logical issue.

### Browsers compatibility

Even though Google Chrome is the [most popular browser nowadays](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share),  there is no monopoly on the browser market, and this is good. So the key task is to make sure that application looks and works properly in a few main browsers, usually it could be the latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

### Mobile devices compatibility

[The number of devices that people use to surf the web is increasing](http://%3Ca%20href%3D%22https//www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics%22rel=%22nofollow%22%3EGoogle%3C/a%3E). To ensure that your website displays correctly on mobile devices, you should test it. The larger your fleet of mobile devices for testing is, the more stable your application will be. Still, not forget that the larger the number of devices for testing, the more protracted and expensive the testing process will be. If you have a small app, then two mobile phones (iOs and Android) and one tablet will probably be enough.

## Ease up, speed up

Optimization during the development process is essential for fast loading of the product on all devices, directly affecting its ranking in search engines. Accordingly, this criterion affects the final monetization one way or another.

### Image optimization

Optimization of images refers to the hygiene of a modern web app. Although the Internet nowadays is fast enough, you should keep in mind slow 3g network and places where people have to surf websites with limited Internet connection, such as the underground. If you can save a hundred or two kilobytes for your user, you must do it.

**Here are a few tools that may help you to optimize your images:**

* for NextJS apps: <https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images>
* for GatsbyJS apps: <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-image/>
* for WordPress apps: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/>

### Nice try

It’s not so easy to anticipate success and foresee fame. Apparently, you’ll never know the truth about your genius without any try or effort. Despite of hard working, Uunnic has been frozen. When we finished our part, the client just didn’t launch the new version of the project. It happens when stakeholders have burnt out or they just have financial problems. Nevertheless, it was a great experience for us and the customer left satisfied with our collaboration.

### Getting feedback

> It was a long and ambitious project during which the team at Heyllow always gave us support and advice in terms of design and user experience. The team worked very closely with us to come up with the best designs and create a simple user flow to provide the best experience when using the site. They are very good communicating and offer their advice and expertise for all small and big details. The best thing is we feel like they don’t work FOR us, they work WITH us, which makes them very valuable members of the team.
