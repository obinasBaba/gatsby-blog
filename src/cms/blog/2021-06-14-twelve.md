The Menu page has a list of categories, which in turn each contain a list of items.
You might notice we are using the label_singular property in a few places. When 
viewing the Menu page in the CMS, it will list “Categories” and “Items.” Without the 
label_singular property, the add buttons would be labeled “Add Categories” and 
“Add Items.” label_singular is used for the label on those buttons so that they are 
grammatically correct: “Add Category” and “Add Item.”
