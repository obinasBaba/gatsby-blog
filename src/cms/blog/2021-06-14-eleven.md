We have added a new collection, called pages, which will contain the Page data. The 
index Page has a contentKey of indexPage and includes a tagline and heroImage field.
Before proceeding, we will need to create the src/pageData directory and add a 
skeleton index.md file. Add the skeleton front matter, including the contentKey, shown 
in Listing 9-7.
